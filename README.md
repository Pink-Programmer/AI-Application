Group Assignment: Stock market prediction


In this project, artificial intelligence is used to predict the stock market. The goal is to train an artificial 
intelligence to make the decision whether to sell the stock or not. With the decisions made, it is 
desired that no losses are made on the sale. The training data is based on a dataset with a total of 
approx. 18000 data. The data such as date, open, high, low, close, volume, dividends and stock splits 
of each day of the share are shown in the dataset. The training will be done with the Random Forest 
technique. Depending on the result of the training, if necessary, the dataset will be expanded or the 
model will be compared with another technique in the field of artificial intelligence.
